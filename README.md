### :person_curly_hair: thaynansilva

Greetings!

My name is Thaynan (pronounced `ta.ee.nan`), and I go by any pronouns.
I'm a young programmer, currently coursing Computer Science. 
I love listening to music, playing retro games, computing and programming.

These are my favorite programming languages: C, Java, and Python.

### :diamonds: Projects

I'm working on some personal projects:
- libclassy: a small object system for the C programming language;
- clover: a very cool cross-platform programming language.

I'm also idealizing some apps for GNOME (my favorite desktop environment!)

### :sparkles: Curiosity

I'm interested in various things and can find even more interests with
the right motivation.
